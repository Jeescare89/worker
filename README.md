Description:
The purpose of the worker class is to find the number of employees, and organize them to set roles. Much of the idea behind this to assign numerous differernt types of sets including their name, ID, and the name. Progressing towards a program that is able to assign methods and assign each of the characters setting each with a certain set of data. 

self
This is meant to recieve the self that the character was set to. Much of the idea is to address the data that is set to this character, binding the attribute with its given argument.

Id:
The integer that is set to this argument, as the identity of the object. Returning the details of the object.

name:
The attribute from the self function set of data, which is represented into the name portion of the fuction module. 

Demo program descrition:
The purpose of this is to set two objects (workers) that are set with 3 different pieces of data. Including the self portion, Id, and the name of the charaters. The program first starts with the number of the worker, which then assignes them with these sets of data. Then printing out the data of worker one, to showcase the purpose of the module.

Running Demo:
To run the demo of the program, you need to run it in terminal, setting as the main function should already have everything set to run.
